# Linux-Automation
This repository contains the documents related to Linux automation with shell script.

Objective:
Create a shell script that automates common system maintenance tasks on a Linux server. The script will help in monitoring system health, performing backups, updating packages, and cleaning up unnecessary files, making the system maintenance process more efficient.

Key Features:
System Health Monitoring:

Check CPU and memory usage using top, vmstat, or sar.
Monitor disk usage using df and alert when disk usage exceeds a certain threshold.
Check the status of critical services (e.g., Apache, MySQL) and restart them if they are not running.
Automated Backups:

Create backups of important directories (e.g., /etc, /home) using tar and compress them.
Automate database backups (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) using mysqldump or pg_dump.
Transfer backups to a remote server using rsync or upload them to a cloud storage service like AWS S3.
Package Management:

Update the system and install security patches using apt, yum, or dnf.
Clean up old packages and unnecessary dependencies.
Log Management:

Rotate logs using logrotate to prevent log files from consuming excessive disk space.
Archive old logs and compress them.
System Cleanup:

Remove old and unused files in /tmp and other directories to free up space.
Clean up unused Docker images and containers (if Docker is used).
Alerts and Notifications:

Send email or Slack notifications with the script's execution status and any issues encountered (e.g., disk space alerts, service restarts).
Scheduling:

Schedule the script to run at regular intervals using cron.
